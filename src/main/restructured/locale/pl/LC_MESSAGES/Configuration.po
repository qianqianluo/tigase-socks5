"To enable Tigase Socks5 Proxy component for Tigase XMPP Server, you need "
"to activate ``socks5`` component in Tigase XMPP Server configuration file"
" (``etc/config.tdsl``). In simples solution it will work without ability "
"to enforce any limits but will also work without a need of database to "
